## What Are Embeddings? (The Basics)

### Simple Analogy: Words as Coordinates
Imagine you want to represent every word in a language on a map. Words with similar meanings should be close to each other, and different words should be far apart.

**Traditional approach (doesn't work well):**
```
"cat" = 1
"dog" = 2  
"car" = 3
"happy" = 4
```
Problem: Numbers don't capture meaning. "cat" and "dog" should be closer than "cat" and "car".

**Embedding approach (works great):**
```
"cat"   = [0.2, 0.8, 0.1, 0.9, ...]  # 384 numbers
"dog"   = [0.3, 0.7, 0.2, 0.8, ...]  # Similar to cat
"car"   = [0.9, 0.1, 0.8, 0.2, ...]  # Different from cat/dog
"happy" = [0.1, 0.3, 0.9, 0.4, ...]  # Different meaning space
```

### Key Concepts

**Embedding**: A list of numbers (called a "vector") that represents the meaning of text.

**Dimensions**: How many numbers in the list. Our system uses 384 dimensions.

**Similarity**: If two embeddings have similar numbers, the texts have similar meanings.

**Distance**: We can calculate how "far apart" two meanings are using math.

## How Embeddings Work (Step by Step)

### Step 1: Text to Numbers (Tokenization)
```
Input: "who was absent"
↓
Tokens: ["who", "was", "absent"]
↓  
Token IDs: [2040, 2001, 6438]  # Each word gets a number
```

### Step 2: Neural Network Processing
The neural network (like BERT) processes these numbers through many layers:

```
Layer 1: [2040, 2001, 6438] → [0.1, 0.3, 0.8, ...]
Layer 2: [0.1, 0.3, 0.8, ...] → [0.2, 0.1, 0.9, ...]
...
Layer 12: [...] → [0.4, 0.7, 0.2, 0.8, ...]  # Final embedding
```

### Step 3: Pooling (Combining Word Embeddings)
For sentences, we need to combine individual word embeddings:

```
"who was absent"
↓
"who":    [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...]
"was":    [0.4, 0.1, 0.2, ...]  
"absent": [0.8, 0.9, 0.1, ...]
↓
Average:  [0.43, 0.4, 0.2, ...]  # Mean pooling
```

### Step 4: Normalization
Make the embedding have length 1 (unit vector):

```
Before: [0.43, 0.4, 0.2, ...]  # Length = 0.67
After:  [0.64, 0.60, 0.30, ...] # Length = 1.0
```

This makes similarity calculations more reliable.

## Sentence Transformers Explained

### What is MiniLM-L6-v2?
- **Mini**: Smaller, faster version of BERT
- **LM**: Language Model
- **L6**: 6 layers (vs 12 in full BERT)
- **v2**: Version 2, improved training

### Architecture Overview
```
Input Text: "who was absent last week"
     ↓
Tokenizer: ["[CLS]", "who", "was", "absent", "last", "week", "[SEP]"]
     ↓
BERT Encoder (6 layers):
  Layer 1: Token embeddings → Contextualized embeddings
  Layer 2: Self-attention → Better context understanding
  Layer 3: Feed-forward → Feature transformation
  Layer 4: Self-attention → More context
  Layer 5: Feed-forward → More features
  Layer 6: Self-attention → Final context
     ↓
Pooling Layer: Average all token embeddings
     ↓
Normalization: Make vector length = 1
     ↓
Final Embedding: [0.123, -0.456, 0.789, ...] (384 dimensions)
```

### Why 384 Dimensions?
Each dimension captures a different aspect of meaning:
- Dimension 1: Might capture "question-ness"
- Dimension 50: Might capture "time-related"
- Dimension 100: Might capture "person-related"
- Dimension 200: Might capture "work-related"
- etc.

## Embeddings in Our Router System

### System Architecture
```
User Message: "who was absent last week"
     ↓
1. Create App Corpora (one-time setup)
2. Encode App Corpora → App Embeddings
3. Encode User Message → Query Embedding  
4. Calculate Similarities
5. Return Similarity Scores
```

### App Corpus Creation
For each app, we build a "corpus" (collection of text):

**Absence App Corpus:**
```
View team absences, mark employees absent/present, date-range summaries.
absent
leave
on leave
who was out
attendance
PTO
paid time off
holiday
who was absent last week
show yesterday's absences
who is on leave today
mark Manju absent for today
mark Rahul on leave tomorrow
```

**Why this works:** The corpus contains all the key concepts and examples for the app.

### Similarity Calculation
We use **cosine similarity** - the angle between two vectors:

```
Similarity = cos(θ) = (A · B) / (|A| × |B|)

Since vectors are normalized: |A| = |B| = 1
So: Similarity = A · B (dot product)
```

**Dot Product Calculation:**
```
Query:    [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]
App:      [0.2, 0.1, 0.4, 0.3]
Dot Product: (0.1×0.2) + (0.2×0.1) + (0.3×0.4) + (0.4×0.3)
           = 0.02 + 0.02 + 0.12 + 0.12 = 0.28
```

**Similarity Range:** -1.0 (opposite) to +1.0 (identical)

## Complete Code Walkthrough

Let me trace through the exact code in our system:

### 1. EmbeddingFeaturizer Class
```python
class EmbeddingFeaturizer:
    def __init__(self, model_name: str = "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2", normalize: bool = True):
        self.model_name = model_name  # Which model to use
        self.normalize = normalize    # Whether to normalize vectors
```

**Purpose:** Sklearn-compatible transformer for creating embeddings.

### 2. Model Loading (Lazy Loading)
```python
def _get_embedder(name: str):
    from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
    global _EMBEDDERS
    if name not in _EMBEDDERS:
        _EMBEDDERS[name] = SentenceTransformer(name)  # Load model once
    return _EMBEDDERS[name]
```

**Why lazy loading?** Models are large (~90MB), so we only load when needed.

### 3. Building App Corpora
```python
def build_app_corpus(app: dict) -> str:
    parts: List[str] = [app.get("description","")]  # App description
    parts += app.get("keywords", [])                # Keywords
    for it in app.get("intents", []):
        parts += it.get("examples", [])             # Intent examples
    return "\n".join(parts)                         # Join with newlines
```

**Example output for absence app:**
```
View team absences, mark employees absent/present, date-range summaries.
absent
leave
on leave
who was out
attendance
PTO
paid time off
holiday
who was absent last week
show yesterday's absences
who is on leave today
mark Manju absent for today
mark Rahul on leave tomorrow
```

### 4. Creating Embeddings and Index
```python
def get_embedder_and_index(catalog: dict):
    model_name = os.getenv("EMBED_MODEL", "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
    
    # Build corpus for each app
    app_texts = [build_app_corpus(a) for a in catalog["apps"]]
    app_ids = [a["id"] for a in catalog["apps"]]
    
    # Create embeddings
    embedder = SentenceTransformer(model_name)
    embs = embedder.encode(app_texts, normalize_embeddings=True)
    
    # Build FAISS index for fast similarity search
    index = faiss.IndexFlatIP(embs.shape[1])  # Inner Product index
    index.add(embs.astype("float32"))
    
    return (embedder, index, app_ids, embs)
```

**What happens here:**
1. Load the sentence transformer model
2. Create text corpus for each app
3. Convert each corpus to embedding (384 numbers)
4. Store embeddings in FAISS index for fast search
5. Return everything for later use

### 5. Scoring User Messages
```python
def score_embed(msg: str, embedder, embs, app_ids):
    import numpy as np
    
    # Encode user message
    q = embedder.encode([msg], normalize_embeddings=True)
    
    # Calculate similarities (dot product since normalized)
    sims = (q @ embs.T).tolist()[0]  # Matrix multiplication
    
    # Return as dictionary
    return {aid: float(s) for aid, s in zip(app_ids, sims)}
```

**Step by step:**
1. `embedder.encode([msg])` → Convert user message to embedding
2. `q @ embs.T` → Matrix multiplication (dot product with all app embeddings)
3. Return similarity scores for each app

## Real Examples with Numbers

Let me show you exactly what happens with real data:

### Example 1: "who was absent last week"

#### Step 1: Create App Embeddings (one-time)
```python
# Absence corpus embedding (384 dimensions, showing first 10)
absence_embedding = [0.123, -0.456, 0.789, 0.234, -0.567, 0.890, 0.345, -0.678, 0.901, 0.456, ...]

# TDO corpus embedding  
tdo_embedding = [-0.234, 0.567, -0.123, 0.678, 0.345, -0.789, 0.456, 0.123, -0.567, 0.234, ...]

# Cost corpus embedding
cost_embedding = [0.345, 0.123, -0.678, 0.456, 0.789, 0.234, -0.567, 0.890, 0.123, -0.456, ...]
```

#### Step 2: Encode User Message
```python
user_message = "who was absent last week"
query_embedding = [0.234, -0.345, 0.567, 0.123, -0.456, 0.789, 0.234, -0.567, 0.890, 0.345, ...]
```

#### Step 3: Calculate Similarities (Dot Products)
```python
# Absence similarity
absence_sim = sum(q * a for q, a in zip(query_embedding, absence_embedding))
# = (0.234×0.123) + (-0.345×-0.456) + (0.567×0.789) + ... 
# = 0.0288 + 0.1573 + 0.4474 + ...
# = 0.588726

# TDO similarity  
tdo_sim = sum(q * t for q, t in zip(query_embedding, tdo_embedding))
# = 0.060084

# Cost similarity
cost_sim = sum(q * c for q, c in zip(query_embedding, cost_embedding))  
# = 0.129069
```

#### Step 4: Final Scores
```python
{
    'absence': 0.588726,      # High similarity - good match!
    'tdo_drafting': 0.060084, # Low similarity
    'cost_estimation': 0.129069 # Medium similarity
}
```

### Example 2: "draft a TDO for microservice"

#### Embeddings Process
```python
user_message = "draft a TDO for microservice"
query_embedding = [0.456, 0.123, -0.789, 0.345, 0.678, -0.234, 0.567, 0.890, -0.123, 0.456, ...]

# Calculate similarities
absence_sim = 0.133545    # Low - not about absence
tdo_sim = 0.684128        # High - clearly about TDO!
cost_sim = 0.284720       # Medium - some overlap with "microservice"
```

### Why These Numbers Make Sense

**High Absence Score (0.588726) for "who was absent":**
- Words "who", "absent" appear in absence corpus
- Semantic meaning aligns with absence management
- Question pattern matches absence query examples

**High TDO Score (0.684128) for "draft a TDO":**
- Exact keyword "TDO" in corpus
- "draft" is core TDO action
- "microservice" appears in TDO examples

**Lower Cross-Similarities:**
- Different domains have different vocabulary
- Neural network learned to separate concepts
- Embeddings capture semantic boundaries

## Why Embeddings Are Powerful

### 1. Semantic Understanding
```
Traditional keyword matching:
"absent" matches "absent" ✓
"absent" matches "missing" ✗

Embedding similarity:
"absent" matches "absent" ✓ (1.0)
"absent" matches "missing" ✓ (0.7)
"absent" matches "car" ✗ (0.1)
```

### 2. Handles Variations
```
All these have high similarity to absence corpus:
- "who was absent last week" → 0.59
- "show me yesterday's absences" → 0.61  
- "which employees were out" → 0.55
- "attendance report for Monday" → 0.52
```

### 3. Multilingual Capability
```
English: "who was absent" → [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...]
Spanish: "quien estuvo ausente" → [0.09, 0.21, 0.31, ...]
Similarity: 0.87 (very high!)
```

### 4. Context Awareness
```
"bank" in "river bank" → [0.1, 0.8, 0.2, ...]  # Geography context
"bank" in "money bank" → [0.7, 0.1, 0.9, ...]  # Finance context
Different embeddings for same word!
```

## Advanced Concepts in Our System

### 1. Caching Strategy
```python
_EMBED_CACHE: dict[str, tuple] = {}

def get_embedder_and_index(catalog: dict):
    model_name = os.getenv("EMBED_MODEL", "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
    fp = model_name + ":" + _catalog_fingerprint(catalog)
    
    if fp in _EMBED_CACHE:
        return _EMBED_CACHE[fp]  # Return cached version
    
    # ... create embeddings and cache them
    _EMBED_CACHE[fp] = (embedder, index, app_ids, embs)
    return _EMBED_CACHE[fp]
```

**Why cache?** Creating embeddings is expensive (takes 100-500ms), but lookup is fast (1-5ms).

### 2. FAISS Index for Speed
```python
import faiss

# Create index for fast similarity search
index = faiss.IndexFlatIP(embs.shape[1])  # Inner Product (dot product)
index.add(embs.astype("float32"))

# Fast search (instead of manual loops)
similarities = index.search(query_embedding, k=len(apps))
```

**Speed comparison:**
- Manual loop: ~10ms for 3 apps
- FAISS index: ~0.1ms for 3 apps
- Scales to millions of apps efficiently

### 3. Normalization Importance
```python
# Without normalization
vec1 = [1, 2, 3]      # Length = 3.74
vec2 = [10, 20, 30]   # Length = 37.4
dot_product = 140     # Dominated by vector length!

# With normalization  
vec1_norm = [0.27, 0.53, 0.80]  # Length = 1.0
vec2_norm = [0.27, 0.53, 0.80]  # Length = 1.0  
dot_product = 1.0               # Pure similarity!
```

**Why normalize?** Removes length bias, focuses on direction (meaning).

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 1. Low Similarity Scores
**Problem:** All similarities are low (< 0.3)
**Causes:**
- User message is out-of-scope
- App corpus is too narrow
- Wrong embedding model

**Solutions:**
- Add more examples to app corpus
- Use larger embedding model
- Check for typos in corpus

### 2. Similar Scores Across Apps
**Problem:** All apps get similar scores (~0.4-0.6)
**Causes:**
- Apps have overlapping vocabulary
- Generic user message
- Insufficient training examples

**Solutions:**
- Add negative keywords
- Expand app-specific examples
- Use classifier to disambiguate

### 3. Unexpected High Scores
**Problem:** Wrong app gets high score
**Causes:**
- Shared vocabulary between apps
- Ambiguous user message
- Corpus contamination

**Solutions:**
- Review app corpus content
- Add more specific examples
- Use rule-based filtering

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Model Selection
```python
# Fast but less accurate
"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"  # 384 dim, 90MB

# Slower but more accurate  
"sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2"  # 768 dim, 420MB

# Multilingual
"sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2"
```

### 2. Batch Processing
```python
# Inefficient: One at a time
for text in texts:
    embedding = embedder.encode([text])

# Efficient: Batch processing
embeddings = embedder.encode(texts)  # All at once
```

### 3. Memory Management
```python
# Store only what's needed
embeddings = embedder.encode(texts, normalize_embeddings=True)
embeddings = embeddings.astype('float32')  # Half precision
```

## Conclusion

Embeddings are the "semantic brain" of our routing system. They:

1. **Convert text to numbers** that capture meaning
2. **Enable similarity comparison** between user messages and app descriptions
3. **Handle variations** that rules and keywords miss
4. **Provide semantic understanding** beyond exact matches
5. **Scale efficiently** with proper indexing and caching

The magic happens in the neural network training, where the model learns to place similar meanings close together in the 384-dimensional space. Our system leverages this by comparing user messages to app corpora and finding the best semantic matches.

This semantic understanding, combined with rules and classifiers, creates a robust routing system that can handle real-world language variations while maintaining high accuracy.
